# Titanic R

# Overview
Kaggle has a competition that uses data about the famous Titanic shipwreck. The objective is to create a machine learning model that can predict if a passenger survived or did not survive the shipwreck. This is a supervised, binary classification problem. The model used was a neural network. The programming language is R.

# Purpose of the Project
First, I wanted to get started with Kaggle and decided this would be a good competition to start with. Second, I wanted to work on creating a neural network in the caret library.

# What Did I Learn
I learned how to implement cross validation into a neural network using the caret library. I learned that most people that survived were female and had tickets on the upper part of the ship. Most people that did not survive were male and had tickets in the bottom of the ship.

# Dataset Used
The dataset that was used was provided by Kaggle already split into train and test sets. The combined datasets had 1309 rows and 12 variables.
